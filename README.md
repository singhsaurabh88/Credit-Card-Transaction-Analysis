# Credit Card Transactions Overview

This dataset contains over <b>26,000 transactions</b> spanning from <b> October 2013 to May 2015 </b>, providing a comprehensive two-year window into consumer spending patterns.
The transactions are linked to four different card typesâ€” <b>Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Signature </b>â€”each likely representing a different tier of customer privileges and benefits.
Spending Categories and Consumer Behavior

<b>Cardholders used their credit cards across a variety of six major expense categories:</b>

    Entertainment
    Food
    Bills
    Fuel
    Travel
    Grocery

These categories suggest a mix of essential spending (bills, groceries, fuel) and discretionary spending (entertainment, food, and travel). This could help in identifying consumer spending trends, such as whether higher-tier cardholders tend to spend more on travel and entertainment, while others focus on necessities.

<b>Geographic Reach</b>

The dataset also reveals that transactions occurred in a wide geographic spread, covering 986 unique cities. This indicates that the card services are widely accepted across various regions, possibly including both metropolitan and smaller cities. Analyzing transaction density by location could help in identifying high-spending regions, potential market expansion opportunities, or regional trends in spending habits.
